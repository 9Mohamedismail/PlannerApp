## Evaluate and Categorize
1. Planner App
    - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for instant logging of mood and thoughts. User's ideally have access to their phones often compared to other devices. User's can use voice memos to keep audio recordings as well as push to remind them to use the app.
    - **Story:** Mental health among teens and adults if often neglected. With the rise of depression, user's can work towards self-care. Allows for tracking of frequent mood changes, organization of thoughts, and identification of patterns.
    - **Market:** Every user can find something unique in this app. However, it is more targeted those who feel disorganized, have mental health issues, or simply want a place to clear their thoughts. The size and scale of the user base would include everyone.
    - **Habit:** This app is very addicting if user's make it a part of their daily routine. Ideally, user's would come to the app once or more everyday, but it is also possible to come once a week or when needed.
    - **Scope:** This app sounds fun and would be something we would benfit from. Adding audio and push might be challenging but otherwise everything else should be doable. 

2. Spotify stats app
    - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for instant checkup, but there is a website and other apps that do this already.
    - **Story:** Not much of a story, just useful for those who want to see their spotify stats.
    - **Market:** The market is small, only spotify users can use this. There are already apps and websites that do the same thing.
    - **Habit:** This app is not something users would use everyday, only maybe once ever or once a couple of months (maybe weeks)
    - **Scope:** This app would only be useful for spotify users and whom want to know their stats.
